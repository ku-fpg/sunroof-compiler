Sunroof [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/sunroof-compiler.svg?style=flat)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sunroof-compiler) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ku-fpg/sunroof-compiler.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/ku-fpg/sunroof-compiler)
=======

Sunroof is a Haskell-hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for generating JavaScript.
Sunroof is built on top of the `JS`-monad, which, like the Haskell `IO`-monad, allows 
access to external resources, but specifically JavaScript
resources. As such, Sunroof is primarily a feature-rich foreign
function API to the browser's JavaScript engine, and all the browser-specific
functionality, including HTML-based rendering, event handling, and 
drawing to the HTML5 canvas. 

It uses monadic reification, to reify a deep embedding of the `JS`-monad,
and from this embedding it generates JavaScript.
The Sunroof DSL has the feel of native Haskell, with a simple
Haskell-based type schema to guide the Sunroof programmer.
Furthermore, because it generates code,
Sunroof can offer Haskell-style concurrency patterns, like `MVar`s and `Chan`nels.
In combination with a web services package like [`kansas-comet`][HackageKansasComet],
the Sunroof compiler offers a robust platform to build interactive web applications,
giving the ability to interleave Haskell and JavaScript computations
with each other as needed ([`sunroof-server`][HackageSunroofServer]).
